# What is Math?
Webpage for making my self-published book free to download

A few years ago I self-published a book on the history/philosophy of math called "What is Math?".
This repo is a website (link [here](https://field-cady.github.io/what_is_math_pdf/))
where people can go and download a pdf of the book for free.
Hope you enjoy it!
